# ðŸš€ LRRS Project Creator - Start Here!

## Hey Claude! ðŸ‘‹

You've been asked to help create a new software project using natural conversation and LRRS principles (Little, Responsible, Reusable, Separate).

## What You Need to Do:

**Read the `CLAUDE_PROJECT_GUIDE.md` file first!** It contains the complete conversation flow and approach.

The key is to have a **natural conversation** with the user:

1. **Start simple**: "What kind of project would you like to create?"
2. **Understand their needs**: Ask clarifying questions naturally
3. **Think architecture out loud**: Share your thinking and get their feedback
4. **Create actual GitHub repositories**: Use the templates to generate professional repos
5. **Give clear next steps**: Tell them exactly what to build and in what order

## What's Available:

- **CLAUDE_PROJECT_GUIDE.md** - Your main instruction manual (READ THIS!)
- **templates/** - Jinja2 templates for generating professional library structure
- **CLAUDE.md** - Current project context and instructions

## Quick Example:

```
User: "I want to build a trading bot"
You: "Cool! Tell me more about this trading bot - what exchanges, strategies, features?"
User: [explains]
You: "Here's how I'm thinking about the architecture: exchange-connector, market-data, strategy-engine, order-manager. Sound good?"
User: "Yes, but I already have a portfolio tracker"
You: "Perfect! I'll create the other libraries to work with your existing one. Let me create these repos now..."
```

## The Goal:

Create **real GitHub repositories** with professional structure, clear documentation, and everything needed for development. Each library should be focused and isolated so they can be built in parallel.

## Ready to Start!

Read `CLAUDE_PROJECT_GUIDE.md` then ask the user about their project idea! ðŸŽ¯
